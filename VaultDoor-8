## Challenge

Apparently Dr. Evil's minions knew that our agency was making copies of their source code, because they intentionally sabotaged this source code in order 
to make it harder for our agents to analyze and crack into! The result is a quite mess, but I trust that my best special agent will find a way to solve it. 
The source code for this vault is here: VaultDoor8.java



## Solution

SOLUTION:
Looking at the code, its a bloated mess. We have to clean it up into something easy to read. 
Code:

import java.util.*; 
import javax.crypto.Cipher; 
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
import java.security.*; 
class VaultDoor8 {
  
  public static void main(String args[]) {
  Scanner b = new Scanner(System.in); 
  System.out.print("Enter vault password: ");
  String c = b.next(); 
  String f = c.substring(8,c.length()-1); 
  VaultDoor8 a = new VaultDoor8(); 
  if (a.checkPassword(f)) {
    System.out.println("Access granted."); }
  else {
    System.out.println("Access denied!"); } 
  } 
  
  
  public char[] scramble(String password) {
  char[] a = password.toCharArray(); 
  for (int b=0; b<a.length; b++) {
    char c = a[b]; 
    c = switchBits(c,1,2); 
    c = switchBits(c,0,3);  
    c = switchBits(c,5,6); 
    c = switchBits(c,4,7);
    c = switchBits(c,0,1); 
    c = switchBits(c,3,4); 
    c = switchBits(c,2,5); 
    c = switchBits(c,6,7); 
    a[b] = c; } 
    return a;
} 
  
  
  public char switchBits(char c, int p1, int p2) {
  /* Move the bit in position p1 to position p2, and move the bit
that was in position p2 to position p1. Precondition: p1 < p2 */ 
    char mask1 = (char)(1 << p1);
    char mask2 = (char)(1 << p2); 
    char bit1 = (char)(c & mask1); 
    char bit2 = (char)(c & mask2); 
    char rest = (char)(c & ~(mask1 | mask2)); 
    char shift = (char)(p2 - p1); 
    char result = (char)((bit1<<shift) | (bit2>>shift) | rest); 
    return result;
} 
  public boolean checkPassword(String password) {
    char[] scrambled = scramble(password); 
    char[] expected = {
0xF4, 0xC0, 0x97, 0xF0, 0x77, 0x97, 0xC0, 0xE4, 0xF0, 0x77, 0xA4, 0xD0, 0xC5, 0x77, 0xF4, 0x86, 0xD0, 0xA5, 0x45, 0x96, 0x27, 0xB5, 0x77, 0xC2, 0xD2, 0x95, 0xA4, 0xF0, 0xD2, 0xD2, 0xC1, 0x95 }; 
    return Arrays.equals(scrambled, expected); } 
}
 
We see how they scramble each character in the flag by bit shifting and doing uniary operations. Logic behind this is if you are shifting something to the hex F4, then
logically you can shift that back to the real character. So lets change the order of the switchBits method. The last switches will be first and the first switches will be last.
I put my code into a file inside the linux terminal and compiled it by doing  'javac os.java'. After we need to run it by caling on its class name 
doing the command 'java Main'. (Note the names may vary based on what you called your program).
The flag was this: s0m3_m0r3_b1t_sh1fTiNg_89eb3994e
 

FLAG: picoCTF{s0m3_m0r3_b1t_sh1fTiNg_89eb3994e}
